# Salt n Peppa Practice

Check out this sweet repo! We're going to use it to practice Forking a repo, Cloning a repo, and making a Pull request.

## Goals

* Add a file to repo called `app.js` and `index.html`
* Put the following in your `app.js` file

```javascript
let name = 'Rome Bell';
console.log(name);

// I know I'm cool but put your name instead. 😎
```

* Leave your `index.html` file empty for now.
* Make a pull request

## Get started

* Fork this repository
* Go to the forked repo on your github
* Copy the ssh or html key
* Go to the directory on your local computer where you want this project to live (for example `Desktop/SEI1019/unit1/labs/`) and put in the command `git clone [YOUR LINK HERE]`.
* Complete all the goals
* Push your changes to your remote repository
* Make a pull request
* Pat yourself on the back
